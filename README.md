This repository contains the final report for my undergraduate thesis titled  
**"Brain Tissue Segmentation Using Different AI Architectures"**,  
submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Epoka University.

## Thesis Overview

This study explores and compares a range of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for brain tissue segmentation on 3D MRI volumes.  
The segmentation targets **gray matter (GM)**, **white matter (WM)**, and **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** using the **IBSR18 dataset**.  
The work aims to evaluate performance across both traditional and deep learning approaches, with a focus on segmentation quality, model architecture, and computational trade-offs.

## Implemented Methods

The following models were developed and evaluated:

- **K-Means** â€“ Unsupervised hard clustering baseline  
- **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** â€“ Soft clustering for probabilistic membership modeling  
- **3D CNN** â€“ Minimal volumetric convolutional baseline  
- **3D U-Net** â€“ Encoderâ€“decoder architecture with skip connections  
- **DenseUNet** â€“ U-Net enhanced with dense blocks and attention gates  
- **Hybrid DenseUNetâ€“U-Net** â€“ Custom model combining dense encoders with U-Net decoding
