This repository contains the final report for my undergraduate thesis titled  
**"Brain Tissue Segmentation Using Different AI Architectures"**,  
submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Epoka University.

## Thesis Overview

This study explores and compares a range of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for brain tissue segmentation on 3D MRI volumes.  
The segmentation targets **gray matter (GM)**, **white matter (WM)**, and **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** using the **IBSR18 dataset**.  
The work aims to evaluate performance across both traditional and deep learning approaches, with a focus on segmentation quality, model architecture, and computational trade-offs.

---

## Implemented Methods

The following models were developed and evaluated:

- **K-Means** â€“ Unsupervised hard clustering baseline  
- **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** â€“ Soft clustering for probabilistic membership modeling  
- **3D CNN** â€“ Minimal volumetric convolutional baseline  
- **3D U-Net** â€“ Encoderâ€“decoder architecture with skip connections  
- **DenseUNet** â€“ U-Net enhanced with dense blocks and attention gates  
- **Hybrid DenseUNetâ€“U-Net** â€“ Custom model combining dense encoders with U-Net decoding

## Dataset

- **Name:** IBSR18 (Internet Brain Segmentation Repository)  
- **Format:** T1-weighted 3D MRI scans (`.nii`)  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Skull stripping  
  - Bias field correction  
  - Image registration  
  - Intensity normalization

## Experimentation Environment

All experiments were conducted using **Google Colab Pro**, utilizing **NVIDIA T4 and A100 GPUs**.  
The following techniques were used to maximize training efficiency:
- Mixed precision training  
- Patch-based input volumes (e.g., `128Â³`)  
- Early stopping and learning rate scheduling  
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay

## Future Work

This thesis can be extended with the following ideas:

- **Transformer-based Models:** Implement Vision Transformers (ViTs) or hybrid CNNâ€“Transformer architectures for volumetric segmentation.
- **Post-Processing Refinement:** Use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or morphological operations to enhance segmentation boundaries.
- **Larger & Multimodal Datasets:** Apply the models to bigger, diverse datasets for better generalization.
- **3D Instance Segmentation:** Explore anatomical structureâ€“level segmentation for finer granularity.
